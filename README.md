# realtime-video-test
A quick sandbox showing live video feed using webRTC to establish a p2p connection, with a socket.io server used as the signalling server. An insertion was also provided to prove that a remote data channel has also been established.

The meat and potatoes of this project are in files: 
  public/js/realtime.js
  server.js

And Yes, the webpage is extraordinary basic...
